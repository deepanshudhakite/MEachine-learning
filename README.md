# MEachine-learning

Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that involves developing algorithms and statistical models that allow computers to progressively improve their performance on a task through experience, without being explicitly programmed. In essence, machine learning enables computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions based on that learning.
